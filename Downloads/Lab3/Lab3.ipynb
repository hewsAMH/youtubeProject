To ensure that your submitted `ipynb` file represents your latest code, make sure to give a fresh `Kernel > Restart & Run All` just before uploading the `ipynb` file to gradescope. **In addition:**\n",

You may either use LaTeX typesetting within a Markdown cell, or do it by hand with pen and paper and embed the image in this .ipynb file, or submit a separate pdf file with your handwritten work. Round all decimals to three places.\n",
